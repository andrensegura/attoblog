# ATTOBLOG

is my attempt at a minimalistic content management system (CMS). The aim is to
provide a platform that gives you everything you need to get blogging without
sacrificing performance.

Though Atto isn't finished, the script is currently in a usable state. If you
upload the files to your domain (doesn't work in a subdirectory!) and edit the
`include/config.json` file, then your site should be good to go!

## Features:

- Create, edit, and delete posts
- Theme selector
- Media management
- Markdown available via [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/)
- ~~Simple installation script~~ (coming soon)
- No databases
- Minimal disk usage (< 100Kb at the time of writing)
